            <h2>Branding from day one is very important!</h2>
            <p>You are your brand. What people say when you leave the room is your brand. Making yourself visible is very important when it comes to branding. The primary purpose of branding is to create loyalty. Loyalty means repeat purchases and loyal fans who will advertise your brand for free... (Ex: when a client checks-in or shares your business page)... Branding is more than just a logo, it is important and paves the way visually, it is emotional, it is how a guest feels about the service that they receive. How the guest sees the style. How the guest ties in the smell of a product with your branding.</p>
